# 0 — Documentation Index & Status Dashboard

Master index for the **Landing Page / Home Page** work on the Nexman MLM
(CodeIgniter) platform. All docs are number-prefixed so future work stays
trackable. Update the **Status** column as features land.

> Convention: new docs get the next free `N_` prefix. Each feature phase has a
> checklist in [4_LANDING_ROADMAP.md](4_LANDING_ROADMAP.md); when a phase is
> delivered, log it in [3_CHANGELOG.md](3_CHANGELOG.md).

## Task board — BMAN Staking project

Working task list for the staking build. When a task lands: tick it here,
log the detail in [3_CHANGELOG.md](3_CHANGELOG.md) (what / files / how to
apply), and update the module doc ([6_STAKING_PACKAGES_PLANS_ROI.md](6_STAKING_PACKAGES_PLANS_ROI.md)).
New tasks get added to the correct phase below.

### Phase A — Admin side (✅ complete, 2026-07-02)

- [x] DB migrations + seeds — `db/staking_module.sql`, `db/staking_rank_power.sql`,
      `db/staking_bonus_settings.sql`, `db/coin_distribution.sql` (all idempotent, applied)
- [x] Staking Packages screen (§4) — CRUD, bonus %, ceiling, enable/disable
- [x] Staking Plans screen (§5) — credit days, durations, combo split
- [x] ROI Structure grid (§6) — versioned + audited edits, history & audit viewers
- [x] Rank Achievement (§10) — 11 ranks, incentives, Plan-1/2/3 requirements editor
- [x] Rank Power & Group Incentive (§11/§12) — rules, 60-day cycles, ceiling editor
- [x] Bonus & Matching (§7/§9) — bonus %, reduction rule, transfer rules, 10=8+2 split
- [x] Coin Distribution Master (§3A) — list/filters/export, add/edit, one-default,
      audit log, purchase snapshot + 4-wallet credit in Make-Investment
- [x] Single Withdraw Settings page — global rules + staking plan windows/limits merged
- [x] Token Settings Master — network/BMAN/USDT/rate/wallets/contracts/chain params,
      one active config, RPC test, IP-audited, legacy `token_config` rate bridge
      (`db/token_settings.sql`)
- [x] Master menu restructure — 9 items (Token · Coin Distribution · Packages ·
      Plans · ROI · Bonus · Wallet · Blockchain · System); no duplicate entries
- [x] Web3 library (`Web3bman`) — isolated web3p/ethereum-tx stack; wallet gen,
      balances, offline-signed BEP-20/BNB sends, all from active Token Settings
      (`application/third_party/web3bman/`, `libraries/Web3bman.php`)

### Phase B — User side + engines (⬜ next)

- [ ] USDT deposit → BMAN conversion flow — read active Token Settings
      (`Tokenmaster_model::activeSettings()` / `convertUsdtToBman()`), credit
      Exchange Wallet; never hardcode the rate
- [ ] User stake purchase flow — resolve ROI cell, snapshot to `user_stakes`,
      credit 25% bonus coin, coin-distribution selection (§3A user side),
      move BMAN Exchange → Staking wallet
- [ ] ROI credit cron — Regular/Combo on 5/15/25 monthly + Fixed at maturity
      → `staking_roi_payouts`
- [ ] Bonus reduction cron — every `reduction_interval_days`, reduce Bonus Wallet
      by `reduction_percent` (reads `staking_bonus_settings`)
- [ ] Bonus transfer flow — direct left/right only, email OTP + transfer password
- [ ] Binary matching bonus payout — 10% split 8% Earning / 2% Staking
      (reads `staking_bonus_settings`)
- [ ] Rank achievement evaluation engine — scan binary tree, award permanent ranks
- [ ] Rank power evaluation + cycle auto-roll cron — fill `user_rank_power`,
      qualify group incentive, auto-open next cycle
- [ ] Group incentive payout — ceiling-capped (`staking_packages.group_ceiling`),
      gated by rank power qualification
- [ ] On-chain withdrawal payout — approve → `Web3bman::sendToken()` (BEP-20)
      from the treasury/gas wallet; store tx hash; retry per Token Settings
      (uses the web3 library, decrypt sending key just-in-time)

### Phase C — Reports & polish (⬜ later)

- [ ] Staking report, ROI paid report, rank report, group incentive report,
      distribution reports (PDF/Excel/CSV per §18)
- [ ] User-facing rank badge / certificate / recognition pages (§10 benefits)
- [ ] Admin dashboard KPI cards for staking (§17)

## Decision log (key choices)

- **PHP server-rendered, not React-CDN.** A React-via-CDN landing was tried but
  failed to render (fell back to the PHP page). The shipped page is the PHP
  dynamic view: responsive (Bootstrap + AOS + Swiper), SEO-friendly (real HTML
  in source), no build step, and editable from the admin. React is **not** used.
  See [3_CHANGELOG.md](3_CHANGELOG.md) §2026-06-30.
- **Single source of truth for meta.** Landing SEO falls back to Site-Settings
  meta; the admin SEO card prefills from it. Editing either keeps them aligned.
- **Permission fallback.** `/landing-page-cms` accepts `landing_page_cms` OR the
  existing `website_content_cms` key, so Content-Management admins aren't locked
  out.
